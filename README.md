# Hide Facebook Content
This Chrome extension hides specified content on Facebook.

## How To Use

1)  Download the files to your computer.
    - If you're using git, create and use a separate folder with `manifest.json` and `hideContent.js`, without the git files.

2)  In the Chrome web browser, go Settings > Extensions.
    - Check the box for "Developer Mode".
    - Click on "Load unpacked exension..." button.
    - Select the folder with the downloaded files.
    - Click "Ok".
    
3)  Make sure the "Enable" checkbox is checked for the extension.

## Add Content To Hide

Before loading the extension to Chrome (step 2 above), edit the `hideContent.js` file. You can change the array of terms (line 2) to your liking.

If you need to make changes in the future, first delete the extension from the list in the settings. Then repeat steps 2 & 3 above.
